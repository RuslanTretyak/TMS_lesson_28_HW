            <a><strong>Rick Sanchez</strong> is one of the titular characters and protagonists on the show losers.
                Rick is a genius scientist and inventor who recently moved in with his daughter and her family after
                years
                of absence. With little regard for typical moral conventions and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge
                and
                adventure, he is the catalyst of many of the series' most bizarre scenarios. He was voiced by Justin
                Roiland
                but has now been replaced by Ian Cardoni.</a>

            <h5>Biography</h5>
            <hr>
            <a>Rick Sanchez is seventy years old. Born on January 26, 1943. very little is known of his life before he
                moved in with the Smith family. What is known is that he and his siblings had a complicated relationship
                with their parents. He also had a wife, Beth's mother, but eventually was killed by later revealed to be
                Prime Rick in Season 7 which prompted him to travel the Universe in search of Prime Rick.<br><br>
                He spent around twenty years presumably traveling through space. During this time, he befriended
                Bird Person and Squanchy and dated a hive mind called Unity. He also began to rebel against the
                Galactic Federation, fighting against them as a rebel alongside Bird Person and others. He was
                also briefly in a band called The Flesh Curtains with Bird Person and Squanchy.</a>

            <h5>Personality</h5>
            <hr>
            <a>Rick is a complicated character with an ambiguous past, which brings into question many of his motivations
                in terms of how he behaves and why.<br><br>
                On the surface, Rick is self-centered, immoral, and sometimes just plain mean. He can be cruel to the
                people around him, often putting down Morty, mocking Jerry, and dismissing Summer and her opinions
                outright. By contrast, he rarely behaves this way toward Beth. This may be because she is the one
                who makes the ultimate decision over whether or not he is allowed to continue living with the family,
                and given how he treats his grandkids, even when he begrudgingly grows to love them, this seems a more
                likely motivation for his treatment than unfiltered affection for his daughter.</a>
